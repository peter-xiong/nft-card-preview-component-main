### What I learned

This was a good starting project for extra practice as I'm new.  Overall the toughest part for me was trying to figure out how to show the view icon when hovering over the image.  I had to walk away from the project and think about how I was going to achieve different states at the same time for parent/child elements when an action happened.  After figuring it out I felt like I leveled up a little more.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development
